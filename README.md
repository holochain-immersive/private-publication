# private-publication

This is an intermidiate Holochain training, with step by step exercises and their tests.

It consists of a private publication hApp that has already been implemented, but only its backend.

## Your goals

Your goal is to re-implement this private publication happ, one step at a time.

To do that, go into `EXERCISES.md` and follow its instructions. Have fun!

## Environment Setup

1. Install the holochain dev environment: https://developer.holochain.org/docs/install/

2. Clone this repo and `cd` inside of it.
3. Enter the nix shell by running this in the root folder of the repository: 

```bash
nix develop
npm install
```

This will install all the needed dependencies in your local environment, including `holochain`, `hc` and `npm`.

Run all the other instructions in this README from inside this nix develop shell, otherwise **they won't work**.

## Testing

```bash
npm test
```
